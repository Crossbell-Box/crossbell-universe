# useIsSsrReady

Hook for indicating Server Side Render (SSR) status.

```ts
import { useIsSsrReady } from "@crossbell/connect-kit";
```

## Usage

Most connect statuses are client-side only.
Hooks that are related to account status, such as `useAccountCharacter`,
will always return `null` during SSR to avoid any potential mismatching issues.

As a result, the UI will render with an unconnected status initially.
To prevent any glitches during the first render, it is recommended to visually hide those components before SSR is ready.

```tsx
import { useIsSsrReady, useIsConnected } from "@crossbell/connect-kit";

function App() {
	const isSsrReady = useIsSsrReady();
	const isConnected = useIsConnected();

	return (
		<button
			style={{
				opacity: isSsrReady ? 1 : 0,
			}}
		>
			{isConnected ? "Disconnect" : "Connect"}
		</button>
	);
}
```

import { UseIsSsrReadyExample } from "@/examples/hooks";

<UseIsSsrReadyExample />
